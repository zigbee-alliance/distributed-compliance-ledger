# DA PKI Revocation

## User Stories

1. Revocation of a VID-scoped PAI

   A Vendor with DCL write privilege can submit a transaction to publish the location of the CRL distribution point for a PAA associated with the Vendor ID. This information can be updated or deleted by the Vendor with the same Vendor ID.

2. Revocation of a DAC 

   A Vendor with DCL write privilege can submit a transaction to publish the location of the CRL distribution point for a PAI associated with the Vendor ID. This information can be updated or deleted by the Vendor with the same Vendor ID.

3. Revocation of a non-VID-scoped PAI

   A Vendor Admin with DCL write privilege can submit a transaction to publish the location of the CRL distribution point for a non-VID scoped PAA. This information can be updated or deleted by any Vendor Admin account.

## A need for Proof-of-possession of `CRLSignerCertificate` key
No additional proof-of-possession is required because 
- The transaction is already signed by the Vendor account key, so only a trusted Vendor can send it.
- DCL checks that `CRLSignerCertificate` is either a valid PAI (signed by a trusted PAA from DCL) or a PAA present on the ledger.
- It can be complicated to create an interactive PoP of `CRLSignerCertificate` for some PAIs.
- Indirect CRLs are out of scope for now

## Transactions

### 1. ADD_PKI_REVOCATION_DISTRIBUTION_POINT
Publishes a PKI Revocation distribution endpoint owned by the Vendor. 

If `crlSignerCertificate` is a PAA (root certificate), then it must be present on DCL.

If `crlSignerCertificate` is a PAI (intermediate certificate), then it must be chained back to a valid PAA (root certificate) present on DCL.
In this case `crlSignerCertificate` is not required to be present on DCL, and will not be added to DCL as a result of this transaction.
If PAI needs to be added to DCL, it should be done via `ADD_X509_CERT` transaction.

Publishing the revocation distribution endpoint doesn't automatically remove PAI (Intermediate certificates)
and DACs (leaf certificates) added to DCL if they are revoked in the CRL identified by this distribution point.

## Validation Logic

### Static validation (before transaction is propagated and proposed to a block)
- All types and constraints (see [Schema](#revocation-distribution-point-schema))
- `DataDigestType` is one of the following values: [1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12].
- `RevocationType` is one of the following values: [1]
- `ProductID` must be empty if `IsPAA` is true. 
- `DataUrl` starts with either `http` or `https` and follow the syntax of [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).
- `DataDigest` is present if and only if the `DataFileSize` field is present.
- `DataDigestType` is provided if and only if the `DataDigest` field is present. 
- `IssuerSubjectKeyID` must consist of even number of uppercase hexadecimal characters ([0-9A-F]), with no whitespace and no non-hexadecimal characters., e.g: `5A880E6C3653D07FB08971A3F473790930E62BDB`.
- If `RevocationType` is 1 (RFC5280 CRL), then `DataFileSize`, `DataDigest`, `DataDigestType` must be empty. This is applied to both Add and Update transactions.
- Check that `ProductID` field is provided if and only if `IsPAA` is false and `CRLSignerCertificate` has a PID in its subject.  
  If `ProductID` is provided, it must be equal to the PID in `CRLSignerCertificate`'s subject.
  - both OID and text versions of PID in a certificate can be supported (either `Mpid` or `1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.2`, see `x509.ToSubjectAsText` method and "2.2. Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields" section in spec)
- If `IsPAA` is true, then
  - check that the `CRLSignerCertificate` is a PAA (root certificate, self-signed).
  - If `CRLSignerCertificate` encodes a vid in its subject, then it must be equal to `VendorID` field.
    - both OID and text versions of VID in a certificate can be supported (either `Mvid` or `1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.1`, see `x509.ToSubjectAsText` method and "2.2. Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields" section in spec)
- If `IsPAA` is false, then
  - check that `CRLSignerCertificate` is a non-root certificate (not self-signed).
  - `CRLSignerCertificate` must encode a vid in its subject equal to `VendorID` field.
    - both OID and text versions of VID in a certificate can be supported (either `Mvid` or `1.3.6.1.4.1.37244.2.1`, see `x509.ToSubjectAsText` method and "2.2. Encoding of Vendor ID and Product ID in subject and issuer fields" section in spec)
