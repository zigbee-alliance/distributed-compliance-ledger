# Setup of Local Net in Docker

- Install Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Download Ubuntu 18.04.3 VDI for VirtualBox from https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/
- In VirtualBox create a VM using the downloaded VDI
- Increase processors count and RAM amount in the created VM settings (set them to a half of physical facilities)
- Start and log in to the created VM using the following credentials: osboxes/osboxes.org
- In Ubuntu VM:
  - Install Go as described at https://golang.org/doc/install
    - Ensure that the following line has been appended to `/etc/profile`:
        ```
        export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
        ```
    - Ensure that the following line has been appended to `~/.profile`:
        ```
        export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
        ```
  - Install Docker as described at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - In `Installation methods` section follow `Install using the repository` method
  - Check whether your user of Ubuntu has been added to `docker` group using the following command:
    ```
    getent group docker | awk -F: '{print $4}'
    ```
    - If it has not been added, add it using `Manage Docker as a non-root user` section from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
  - Install Docker Compose as described at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
  - In any location that you prefer within your user home directory (`~`) execute the following command to clone DC Ledger project:
    ```
    git clone https://gitlab.dsr-corporation.com/dc-ledger/dc-ledger.git
    ```
  - In the the root directory of the cloned project execute the following commands to create and start DC Ledger pool in Docker:
    ```
    make install
    make localnet_init
    make localnet_start
    ```
  - Execute the following command:
    ```
    dclcli
    ```
    - This command runs DC Ledger CLI. Without any arguments it shows the help on the command usage
  - To stop the pool execute:
    ```
    make localnet_stop
    ```
  - Then you can start the pool again with the existing data using `make localnet_start`
  - If you need to start a new clean pool then do the following steps prior to executing `make localnet_start`:
    - Remove `.dclcli` and `.dcld` directories from your user home directory (`~`)
    - Remove `localnet` directory from the root directory of the cloned project
    - Initialize the new pool data using `make localnet_init`
