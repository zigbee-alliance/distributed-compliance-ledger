# DCLedger Monitoring

## Overview

As long as DCLedger is built on top of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint their monitoring abilities can be considered for DCLedger as well.

* Starting from `v0.21.0` Tendermint provides Prometheus compatible [metrics](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/metrics.html).
* Starting from `v0.40.0` Cosmos SDK provides [telemetry](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/core/telemetry.html) package as a server-side support for application performance and behavior explorations.

## Installation & Configuration

Server:

* set server settings as described in [Tendermint Metrics](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/metrics.html)
* restart the `cosmovisor` service
* configure a firewall (if any) so incoming HTTP connections to prometheus port would be allowed
* verify (e.g. `curl IP:PORT`): you should see the metrics along with the values

Client:

* install [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).
* prepare prometheus configuration file
  * please check Prometheus docs for more details
  * example: [bench/prometheus.yml](../bench/prometheus.yml)

## Prometheus Run

Run

```bash
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

And open `http://localhost:9090/` to query and monitor the server-side metrics.
