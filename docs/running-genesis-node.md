## Running a Genesis Validator Node

This document describes in details how to configure a genesis (first) validator node.

Here we assume (for simplicity) that the genesis block consists of a single node only.
Please note that nothing prevents you from adding more nodes to the genesis file by adapting the instructions accordingly.
 
### Hardware requirements

Minimal:
- 1GB RAM
- 25GB of disk space
- 1.4 GHz CPU

Recommended (for highload applications):
- 2GB RAM
- 100GB SSD
- x64 2.0 GHz 2v CPU

### Operating System

Current delivery is compiled and tested under `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS` so we recommend using this distribution for now. In future, it will be possible to compile the application for a wide range of operating systems thanks to Go language.

## Components

The latest release can be found at [DCL Releases](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases).

The following components will be needed:

* Binary artifacts (part of the release):
    * dcld: The binary used for running a node.
    * dclcli: The binary that allow users to interact with the network of nodes.
* The service configuration file `dcld.service` 
(either part of the release or [deployment](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/deployment) folder).    


### Deployment steps

1. Put `dcld` and `dclcli` binaries to `/usr/bin/` and configure permissions.

2. Choose the chain ID. Every network (for example, test-net, main-net, etc.)
must have a unique chain ID.

3. Configure dclcli:
    * `dclcli config chain-id <chain-id>` - the chosen unique chain ID.
    * `dclcli config output json` - Output format (text/json).
    * `dclcli config indent true` - Add indent to JSON response.
    * `dclcli config trust-node false` - Verify proofs for node responses.
    * `dclcli config node tcp://localhost:26657` - Address of the genesis node (this is a local node). 

4. Prepare keys:
    * Derive a new private key and encrypt to disk: `dclcli keys add <name>`.
    Expected output format: 
        ```json
        {
          "name": <name>, // key name. can be used for signing transactions
          "type": "local",
          "address": string, // bench32 encoded address
          "pubkey": string, // bench32 encoded public key
          "mnemonic": string // seed that can be used to generate the same private/public key pair
        }
        ```
    * Remember generated `address` and `pubkey` they will be used later. 
    You can retrieve `address` and `pubkey` values anytime using `dclcli keys show <name>`. 
    Of course, only on the machine where the keypair was generated.

5. Prepare genesis node configuration:

    * Initialize new configuration: `dcld init <node-name> --chain-id <chain-id>`.
    * Add genesis account with the generated key and `Trustee`, `NodeAdmin` roles:
    `dcld add-genesis-account --address=<address> --pubkey=<pubkey> --roles="Trustee,NodeAdmin"`
    * Optionally, add other genesis accounts using the same command.
    * Create genesis transaction: `dcld gentx --from <name>`, where `<name>` is the keys' name specified at Step 4. 
    * Collect genesis transactions: `dcld collect-gentxs`.
    * Validate genesis file: `dcld validate-genesis`.
    * Genesis file is located in `$HOME/.dcld/config/genesis.json`. Give this file to each new node admin.

6. Run node:
    * Open `26656` (p2p) and `26657` (RPC) ports. 
        * `sudo ufw allow 26656/tcp`
        * `sudo ufw allow 26657/tcp`
    * Edit `dcld.service`
        * Replace `ubuntu` with a user name you want to start service on behalf
    * Copy service configuration.
        * `cp dcld.service /etc/systemd/system/`
    * Make your node public:
        * Open `$HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml`
        * Find the line under `# TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on`
        * Change it to: `laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"`
    * Optionally, edit `$HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml` in order to set different setting (like listen address).
    * Enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable dcld`
    * Start node: `sudo systemctl start dcld`
    * For testing purpose the node can be started in CLI mode: `dcld start` (instead of two previous `systemctl` commands).
    Service mode is recommended for demo and production environment.
    
    * Use `systemctl status dcld` to get the node service status. 
    * Use `journalctl -u dcld.service -f` to see node logs. 
    * You can also check node status by executing the command `dclcli status` to get the current status.
      The value of `latest_block_height` reflects the current node height.
       
7. Check that genesis account is created:

    * In order to ensure that account is created and has assigned role you can use the command: 
    `dclcli query auth account --address=<address>`.
    Expected output format: 
        ```json
        {
          "result": {
            "address": string, // bench32 encoded address
            "public_key": "string, // bench32 encoded public key
            "roles": [
              "NodeAdmin", "Trustee"
            ],
            "coins": [],
            "account_number": string,
            "sequence": string
          },
          "height": string
        }
        ```

8. Check the node is running and participates in consensus:
    * Get the list of all nodes: `dclcli query validator all-nodes`. 
    The node must present in the list and has the following params: `power:10` and `jailed:false`.

    * Get the node status: `dclcli status --node <node ip>`. 
    The value of `node ip` matches to `[rpc] laddr` field in `$HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml`
    (TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on).  
    Make sure that `result.sync_info.latest_block_height` is increasing over the time (once in about 5 sec).
       Expected output format: 
        ```json
        {
          "node_info": {
            "protocol_version": {
              "p2p": "7",
              "block": "10",
              "app": "0"
            },
            "id": string, // matches to prefix <ID> of the file: $HOME/.dcld/config/gentx/gentx-<ID>.json
            "listen_addr": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656", // Address to listen for incoming connections. Matches to $HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml [p2p] `laddr` filed.
            "network": "<chain-id>",
            "version": "0.32.8",
            "channels": string,
            "moniker": string,
            "other": {
              "tx_index": "on",
              "rpc_address": "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657" // TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on. Matches to $HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml [rpc] `laddr` filed. 
            }
          },
          "sync_info": {
            "latest_block_hash": string,
            "latest_app_hash": "string,
            "latest_block_height": string,
            "latest_block_time": string,
            "catching_up": bool
          },
          "validator_info": {
            "address": string,
            "pub_key": {
              "type": string,
              "value": string
            },
            "voting_power": string
          }
        }
        ```
    
    * Get the list of nodes participating in the consensus for the last block: `dclcli tendermint-validator-set`.
        * You can pass the additional value to get the result for a specific height: `dclcli tendermint-validator-set 100`.
        * As for the genesis state we have just 1 node, the command should return only our node at this phase.
      
9. Add more initial trusted validator nodes to the network
   * Let's add more nodes that will be considered as trusted persistent peers by other nodes.
   * Create a sub-folder in [deployment](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/deployment/persistent_chains)
   with the chosen chain ID (Step 2) as a name. 
   * Persist the genesis file in the created chain-id subfolder.
   The genesis file can be found in `$HOME/.dcld/config/genesis.json` (Step 5). 
   * Create the `persistent_peers.txt` file from the template located in [deployment](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/deployment)
   and persist it in the chain-id subfolder. 
      * If there is only one genesis node (like in the current tutorial), it will contain 
      a single entry `<node1_id>@<node1_IP>:26656`.
      * `<node1_id>` - Node ID. Can be found as an `<ID>` prefix of the file `$HOME/.dcld/config/gentx/gentx-<ID>.json`.
      * `<node1-IP>` - public IP address of the genesis node. 
   * Every node that needs to join the network should follow the [Running Node](running-node.md) instructions
   using the chosen chain-id and the genesis and persistent_peers files above (or from the chain-id subfolder).
   * Update the `persistent_peers.txt` file by including the entries for every added initial node.
   * Update the `persistent_peers` field in `$HOME/.dcld/config/config.toml`
    for every initial node (including the genesis one) to match the `persistent_peers.txt` content.
        * See Step 4 from [Running Node](running-node.md) for details.

10. Adding more validator nodes to the network
    * Just follow the [Running Node](running-node.md) instructions 
    using the chosen chain-id and the genesis and persistent_peers files above (from the chain-id subfolder).
       * Please make sure, that the persistent_peers contain all the nodes (including the genesis node)
    added at Step 9.
