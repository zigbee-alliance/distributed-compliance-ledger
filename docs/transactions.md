# Transactions and Queries
See use case sequence diagrams for the examples of how transaction can be used.

## General
- Every writer to the Ledger must  
    - Have a private/public key pair.
    - Have an Account created on the ledger via `ACCOUNT` transaction (see [Use Case Txn Auth](use_cases/use_cases_txn_auth.puml)).
        - The Account stores the public part of the key
        - The Account has an associated role. The role is used for authorization policies.
    - Sign every transaction by the private key.
- Ledger is public for read which means that anyone can read from the Ledger without a need to have 
an Account or sign the request.  
- The following roles are supported:
    - Trustee
    - Vendor
    - TestHouse
    - ZBCertificationCenter
    - NodeAdmin   
- All read (get) requests return the current `height` of the ledger in addition to the
requested data. The `height` can be used to get a delta (changes) from the last state that the user has.
This is useful to avoid correlation by the sender's IP address.        

## How to write to the Ledger
- Local CLI
    - CLI is started in a CLI mode.
    - Generate and store a private key for the Account to be used for sending.
    - Send transactions to the ledger from the Account (`--from`).
        - it will automatically build a request, sign it by the account's key, and broadcast to the ledger.
    - See `CLI` section for every write request (transaction).
    - Example
        ```json
        dclcli tx modelinfo add-model 1 1 "Device #1" "Device Description" "SKU12FS" "1.0" "2.0" true --from cosmos1ar04n6hxwk8ny54s2kzkpyqjcsnqm7jzv5y62y
        ```
- CLI (keys at the edge)
    - There are two CLIs are started in a CLI mode.
        - CLI 1: Stores private key. Does not have a connection to pool.
        - CLI 2: Is connected to pool. Doesn't has access to private key.
    - CLI 1: A private key is generated and stored off-server (in the user's private wallet).
    - CLI 2: Register account containing generated `Address` and `PubKey` on the ledger.
    - CLI 2: Build transaction using the account (`--from`) and `--generate-only` flag.
    - CLI 2: Fetch `account number` and `sequence`
    - CLI 1: Sign the transaction manually. `dclcli tx sign [path-to-txn-file] --from [address] --account-number [value] --sequence [value] --gas "auto" --offline`
    - CLI 2: Broadcast signed transaction using CLI (`broadcast command)
    - Example
        ```json
        CLI 2: dclcli tx modelinfo add-model 1 1 "Device #1" "Device Description" "SKU12FS" "1.0" "2.0" true --from cosmos1ar04n6hxwk8ny54s2kzkpyqjcsnqm7jzv5y62y --generate-only
        CLI 2: dclcli query auth accounts
        CLI 1: dclcli tx sign /home/artem/dc-ledger/txn.json --from cosmos1ar04n6hxwk8ny54s2kzkpyqjcsnqm7jzv5y62y --account-number 0 --sequence 24 --gas "auto" --offline --output-document txn.json
        CLI 2: dclcli tx broadcast /home/artem/dc-ledger/txn.json
        ```
- Non-trusted REST API (keys at the edge):
    - CLI is started in a server mode.
    - A private key is generated and stored off-server (in the user's private wallet).
    - Build transaction one of the following ways
        - The user builds the transaction manually (see `Extensions` section to find transactions format):.
        - The user does a `POST` to the server specifying the transaction parameters. The server builds the transaction.
        - The user uses corresponding CLI commands with specifying of `--generate-only` flag.
    - Sign the transaction manually using CLI or `tx/sign` endpoint.
    - The user does a `POST` of the signed request to the CLI-based server for broadcasting using `tx/broadcast`.     
    - Example
        ```json
        POST /modelinfo/models
        POST tx/sign
        POST tx/broadcast
        ```
- Trusted REST API (keys at the server):
    - CLI is started in a server mode.
    - A private key is generated and stored on the server (assuming it's within the user's domain and the user trusts it).
    - The user sends a POST to the server specifying the transaction parameters and account details (passphrase etc.) using `Authorization` header`.
    The server builds the request, signs it by the specified account's private key and broadcasts to the ledger
     in a way similar to the local CLI case.
    - See `REST API` section for every write request (transaction).
    - Example
        ```json
        POST /modelinfo/models with setting Authorization header 
        ```

## How to read from the Ledger
- Local CLI
    - CLI is started in a CLI mode.
    - No keys/account is needed as the ledger is public for reads
    - See `CLI` section for every read request.
- REST API
    - CLI is started in a server mode.
    - No keys/account is needed as the ledger is public for reads
    - See `REST API` section for every read request.   
    
##### Query types     
- Query single value:
    - By default, all read requests are performed for the last ledger state (height) and 
        then state proof verification is performed for result values.
        In order to verify state proof, app must have the next ledger state (height + 1) which will be created after some time.
        Because of this expectation queries may take significant time. 
    
        In order to avoid this delay CLI and REST exposes optional flag/parameter `prev-height`.
        When this flag is specified read requests will be performed for previous state (height-1). 
        The next state (height) is already present on the ledger so state proof verification is performed immediately.
    
        Note:     
        * In case simple reading use `prev-height` flag to get quick response.
        * In case of sequent add/read requests flag `prev-height` can be used. In case of failure for height-1 one more request for current height will be sent.
        * In case of sequent update/read requests flag `prev-height` must not be used because data before modification can be returned.
             
- Query list of values:
    - At the current moment, there is no state proof verification for list queries so there are no delays for those queries.

## CERTIFY_DEVICE_COMPLIANCE

#### CERTIFY_MODEL
Attests compliance of the Model to the ZB standard.

`REVOKE_MODEL_CERTIFICATION` should be used for revoking (disabling) the compliance.
It's possible to call it for revoked models to enable them back. 

The corresponding Model Info and test results must be present on ledger.

It must be called for every compliant device for use cases where compliance 
is tracked on ledger.
It can be used by use cases where only revocation is tracked on the ledger to remove a Model
from the revocation list.
 
- Parameters:
    - `vid`: 16 bits int
    - `pid`: 16 bits int
    - `certification_date`: rfc3339 encoded date - date of certification
    - `certification_type`: string  - `zb` is the default and the only supported value now
    - `reason` (optional): string  - optional comment describing the reason of the certification
- In State:
  - `compliance` store  
  - `1:<certification_type>:<vid>:<pid>` : `<compliance info>`
  - `2:<vid>` : `<compliance pids>`  
  - `3:<vid>` : `<revoked pids>`  
- Who can send: 
    - ZBCertificationCenter
- CLI command: 
    -   `dclcli tx compliance certify-model --vid=<uint16> --pid=<uint16> --certification-type=<zb> --certification-date=<rfc3339 encoded date> --from=<account> .... `
- REST API: 
    -   PUT `/compliance/certified/vid/pid/certification_type`
    
#### REVOKE_MODEL_CERTIFICATION
Revoke compliance of the Model to the ZB standard.

The corresponding Model Info and test results are not required to be on the ledger 
to be used in cases where revocation only is tracked on the ledger.

It can be used in cases where every compliance result 
is written on the ledger (`CERTIFY_MODEL` was called), or
 cases where only revocation list is stored on the ledger.
 
- Parameters:
    - `vid`: 16 bits int
    - `pid`: 16 bits int
    - `revocation_date`: rfc3339 encoded date - date of revocation
    - `certification_type` string - `zb` is the default and the only supported value now
    - `reason` (optional): string - optional comment describing the reason of the revocation
- In State:
  - `compliance` store  
  - `1:<certification_type>:<vid>:<pid>` : `<compliance info>`
  - `2:<vid>` : `<compliance pids>`  
  - `3:<vid>` : `<revocation pids>`  
- Who can send: 
    - ZBCertificationCenter
- CLI command: 
    -   `dclcli tx compliance revoke-model --vid=<uint16> --pid=<uint16> --certification-type=<zb> --revocation-date=<rfc3339 encoded date> --from=<account> .... `

#### GET_CERTIFIED_MODEL
Gets a boolean if the given Model (identified by the `vid`, `pid` and `certification_type`) is compliant to ZB standards. 

This is the aggregation of compliance and
revocation information for every vid/pid. It should be used in cases where compliance 
is tracked on the ledger.

Note: This function returns `false` in two cases:
- compliance information not found in the store.
- compliance information is found but it is in `revoked` state. 

You can use `GET_COMPLICE_INFO` method to get the whole compliance information.
 
- Parameters:
    - `vid`: 16 bits int
    - `pid`: 16 bits int
    - `certification_type`: string - `zb` is the default and the only supported value now

It contains information about revocation only, so it should be used in cases
 where only revocation is tracked on the ledger.

Note: This function returns `false` in two cases:
- compliance information not found in the store.
- compliance information is found but it is in `certified` state. 
 
You can use `GET_COMPLICE_INFO` method to get the whole compliance information.

- Parameters:
    - `vid`: 16 bits int
    - `pid`: 16 bits int

- Result:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "value": bool
  },
  "height": string
}
```

#### GET_COMPLIANCE_INFO
Gets compliance information associated with the Model (identified by the `vid` and `pid` and `certification_type`).

It can be used instead of GET_CERTIFIED_MODEL / GET_REVOKED_MODEL methods
