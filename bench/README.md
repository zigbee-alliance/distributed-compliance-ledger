# DCLedger Load Testing

DCLedger testing is implemented in python3 and based on [Locust](https://locust.io/) framework.

## Requirements

- python >= 3.7
- Install Docker as described at <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>

  - In `Installation methods` section follow `Install using the repository` method

    - Check whether your user of Ubuntu has been added to `docker` group using the following command:

    ```bash
    getent group docker | awk -F: '{print $4}'
    ```

    - If it has not been added, add it using `Manage Docker as a non-root user` section from <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/>

- Install Docker Compose as described at <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

## Installation

Run (consider to use virtual environment):

```bash
pip3 install -r bench/requirements.txt
```

**Optional** If you need to monitor server-side metrics please install [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

## Preparation

- If you run load tests on a local pool, follow the steps below (**this item is needed only for a local pool**):

  - Each write transactions is signed and thus requires:

    - an account with write permissions (e.g. Vendor account)
    - proper values for txn `sequence` which enforces txns ordering for an account

  - Initialize the pool and test accounts (**Warning** applicable to local in-docker pool only for now):

```bash
make localnet_clean
make localnet_init
make localnet_start
# Note: once started ledger may require some time to complete the initialization.
```

- Copy accounts keys to folder `~/.dcl/keyring-test`:

  - After connecting to the network, we must copy the `Trustee` account keys to `~/.dcl/keyring-test`.
    `The number of accounts with role Trustee must not exceed 3`.
  - If you run the test against a local pool, the account keys can be copied as follows:

    ```bash
    cp ./.localnet/node0/keyring-test/* ~/.dcl/keyring-test
    ```

- Go to `bench` folder

  ```bash
  cd bench
  ```

- Open the .env file:

  - update fields.
    e.g.:

    ```yml
    DCLD_VERSION=v0.11.0
    DCLD_NODE=tcp://host.docker.internal:26657
    DCLD_CHAIN_ID=dclchain

    WRITE_HOSTS=http://host.docker.internal:26657
    READ_HOSTS=http://host.docker.internal:26640
    TRUSTEE_ACCOUNT_NAME=jack
    COUNT_USERS=4

    CSV_REPORT_FILE_NAME=example
    HTML_REPORT_FILE_NAME=example
    ```

    `<DCLD_VERSION>` - dcld binary version.
    `<DCLD_NODE>` - Address `<host>:<port>` of the node to connect. This node needs for adding account with role `Vendor` in write load tests. Default value in local in docker nodes is `tcp://host.docker.internal:26657`
    `<DCLD_CHAIN_ID>` - unique chain ID of the network you are going to connect.
    `<WRITE_HOSTS>` - hosts for writing load tests. Default value in local in docker nodes is `http://host.docker.internal:26657`
    `<READ_HOSTS>` - hosts for reading load tests. Default value in local in docker nodes is `http://host.docker.internal:26640`
    `<TRUSTEE_ACCOUNT_NAME>` - trustee account name. `Trustee` account, which will add account with `Vendor` role in write load tests.
    `<COUNT_USERS>` - number of users in load tests. `Number of users should be equal to number of workers for write tests.`
    `<CSV_REPORT_FILE_NAME>` - generates a set of stat files (summary, failures, exceptions and stats history).
    `<HTML_REPORT_FILE_NAME>` - generates an html report
    Web UI also includes Download Data tab where the reports can be found.

    > **_Note:_** The above options can either point to local in docker nodes or to external nodes.

- Build `docker-compose` file

  ```bash
  docker compose build
  ```

## Run

### (Optional) Launch Prometheus

```bash
prometheus --config.file=bench/prometheus.yml
```

And open `http://localhost:9090/` to query and monitor the server-side metrics.

### Headless

To run write load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new `command` for `master` and `worker`.  
   e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
    - "WriteModelLoadTest"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`:

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
    - "WriteModelLoadTest"
  ```

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new field `extra_hosts` for `master` and `worker` (**this item need only for the local pool**):
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  `<host.docker.internal:host-gateway>` - need to connecting to localhost from locust container.

- Run docker-compose.yml

  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine. `Number of users should be equal to number of workers for write tests.`

To run read load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new `command` for `master` and `worker`.  
   e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
    - "ReadModelLoadTest"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`:

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
    - "ReadModelLoadTest"
  ```

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new field `extra_hosts` for `master` and `worker` (**this item need only for the local pool**):
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  `<host.docker.internal:host-gateway>` - need to connecting to localhost from locust container.

- Run docker-compose.yml

  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine.

To run write/read load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new `command` for `master` and `worker`.  
   e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`:

  ```yml
  command:
    - "--headless"
  ```

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new field `extra_hosts` for `master` and `worker` (**this item need only for the local pool**):
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
  ```

  `<host.docker.internal:host-gateway>` - need to connecting to localhost from locust container.

- Run docker-compose.yml

  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine. `Number of users should be equal to number of workers for write tests.`

### Web UI

To run write load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new `command` for `master` and `worker`.
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  command:
    - "WriteModelLoadTest"
  ```

  e.g.: for `worker`:

  ```yml
  command:
    - "WriteModelLoadTest"
  ```

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new field `extra_hosts` for `master` and `worker` (**this item need only for the local pool**):
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine. `Number of users should be equal to number of workers for write tests.`

To run read load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new `command` for `master` and `worker`.  
   e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml
  command:
    - "ReadModelLoadTest"
  ```

  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine.

To run write/read load tests

- Open the docker-compose.yml and add a new field `extra_hosts` for `master` and `worker` (**this item need only for the local pool**):
  e.g.: for `master`

  ```yml

- Run docker-compose.yml

  ```bash
  docker compose up --scale worker=<workers-count>
  # The workers run your Users and send back statistics to the master. The master instance doesn't run any Users itself. Both the master and worker machines must have a copy of the locustfile when running Locust distributed.
  ```

  `<workers-count>`- number of machine. `Number of users should be equal to number of workers for write tests.`

Then you can open `http://localhost:8089/` and launch the tests from the browser.

More details can be found in:

- [locust.conf](../locust.conf): default values
- `locust --help` (being in the project root)

### Re-run

**Warning** applicable to local in-docker pool only for now

Next time when you run the test using the same data you will likely get many (all) failures since DCLedger
will complain about already written data or wrong sequence numbers.

For that case you may consider to reset the ledger as follows:

```bash
make localnet_reset localnet_start
```

## FAQ

### locust may complain about ulimit values for open files

Please check the details [here](https://github.com/locustio/locust/wiki/Installation#increasing-maximum-number-of-open-files-limit).

## ToDo

- consider different types of tx: async, sync (currently used), commit
